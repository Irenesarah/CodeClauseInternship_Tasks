Diagnosing a brain tumor takes a long time and relies heavily on the radiologistâ€™s abilities and experience. The amount of data that must be handled has increased dramatically as the number of patients has increased, making old procedures both costly and ineffective. Many researchers investigated a variety of algorithms for detecting and classifying brain tumors that were both accurate and fast. Deep Learning (DL) approaches have recently been popular in developing automated systems capable of accurately diagnosing or segmenting brain tumors in less time. DL enables a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for medical images, specifically for classifying brain cancers.
